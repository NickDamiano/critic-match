Learned

- handling exceptions
- active record queries
	- grouping
	- joins
- rails api returns
-javascript promises
- planning, using pseudocode, writing out models and things ahead of time and thinking critically 
cronjobs and whenever gem, yaml dump into production database, pushing database to herokuok

Bugs
- would scrape the link, then try to go to critic-reviews of that link, main link would resolve to different name with number changed to number but that wouldn't happen for critic reviews
- top match wouldn't count up because the logic was if the user review was a higher percentage but it didn't automatically update if it were the same critic

design challenges
- how do you serve movies effectively? threshold for number of reviews? ask about genre
- how many reviews per page? do you have login? do you use session or local variables?
- how do you match the most efficiently? First attempt was to 
- Very few 0 score movies so scores range from 10 to 90

This project is a good example of why I love to code. Sometimes we wonder something like, I wish I knew blank, how can i find that out, oh it doesn't really exist or is not in a form that is very helpful to me, I can build it to quote bob the builder

I learned that when you add features you didn't originally scope out, the data structure you built can be insufficient and it can cause a heavy toll for your database calls and front end processing storage etc. and if you have to scrape for 2 weeks to get everything without getting blocked, the idea of changing the data structure is not a fun one. And that there should be something faster with scraping i can do
