Now

Front end
- Move javascript to js file
- add critics page /critics/:id
	- displays two bars with 0 space on top of each other with user and critic name next to it
	to the left is the thumbnail and name
	we don't need api call, we can just find the movies array? or we do because of active or we can create a second object that holds all the movies and the active movies and acts as a reference for us to draw on when we are listing movies on critics page
- make sure i'm not pulling duplicates or that there are no duplicate movies
Scraper
- fix cron job for production database
- push database to heroku
- record video showing code and app
- Javascript tests with mocha or jasmine

Later
- when reviews are done. delete all movie reviews that are older than 5 years and movies that are older than 5 years. 

stretch
- add mobile support
	critic matcher title gets smaller
	critic name and percentage only
	have only two movies centered and have some logic to prevent more


Bugs
- when you click on the critic match header it flashes movies in a row below for a second before loading just the top six
- figure out why in theater scraper fails at "rought night" saying 
NoMethodError: undefined method `search' for nil:NilClass
/Users/nickdamiano/code/critic-match/critic-match/app/jobs/metacritic_scraper.rb:94:in `scrape_one_movies_reviews'
- all movies has 12 movies temporarily because it pulls 6 and also gets 6 more which means when i do delete active from all it deletes 12 instead of 6 whenever i'm refreshing the page. if i just load it once and click on the movies it will not have that problem.

Ideas for later
See critics who are reviewing movies today that have been active up to 20 years, if it's significant, try it with them where you find a list of cult movies and mix those in with each page. also probably have to see first last name and maybe combine
- it would be cool if the app could detect which movies they were rating and which they weren't seeing and adjust the movies it asked them, like by genre without asking them. 
- After you get a critic you can rate movies just with him or just him and the top 3 are compared to refine it the most?
