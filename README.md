# Critic Matcher

Critic Matcher Main Page

The user selects 1 through 5 or have not seen and their top matches are updated each review submission. The movies presented are from the last 3 years. The goal is to help the user find a movie critic they align with and can see which movies they also might like and know which critic to follow going forward.
