So now when i destroy all it also destroys the critic and creates a new critic i think 

update scraper to add date



Next couple of days
Look at mobile
Look at creating some sort of intro / instructions
Test actual api call for recent scrape and invidivual movie scrape
Set up the scheduler / cron job


Later
Fix when movies are loaded again that it retains old movies and pulls duplicates to reduce api calls. 
Remove the code for multiple moves on a page
See why scraper fails sometimes despite rescue 
Figure faster way to do against the grain


Scraper
- record video showing code and app
- Javascript tests with mocha or jasmine


Bugs
- figure out why in theater scraper fails at "rought night" saying 
NoMethodError: undefined method `search' for nil:NilClass
/Users/nickdamiano/code/critic-match/critic-match/app/jobs/metacritic_scraper.rb:94:in `scrape_one_movies_reviews'

Notes
Is there something inherently wrong about the database models that makes this so slow
