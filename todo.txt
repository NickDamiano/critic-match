update scraper to add date



Next couple of days
Look at mobile
Look at creating some sort of intro / instructions
Test actual api call for recent scrape and invidivual movie scrape
Set up the scheduler / cron job
Figure out what did i put for how the top 3 matches work because i've rated 5 movies so far and it's still showing 1 result


Later
Fix when movies are loaded again that it retains old movies and pulls duplicates to reduce api calls. 
Remove the code for multiple moves on a page
- add genre exclusion - this needs to happen there are so many movies I haven't seen
See why scraper fails sometimes despite rescue 
Figure faster way to do against the grain
- I want to add a movie page where it shows the title of the movie and the reviewers below with the score and names
- I want the movies hyperlinked to /movie/:id from the critic page
- I want the critics hyperlinked from the movies page
- I want to be able to review some movies, see top critics, click the critics, see matches, see a movie that i know i liked that others didn't like, then click 
	on the movie
- Ideally the critic page displays movies for a critic matched at top if there are any then the other ifelds then all movies reviewed with highest metacritic difference


Scraper
- record video showing code and app
- Javascript tests with mocha or jasmine


Bugs
- figure out why in theater scraper fails at "rought night" saying 
NoMethodError: undefined method `search' for nil:NilClass
/Users/nickdamiano/code/critic-match/critic-match/app/jobs/metacritic_scraper.rb:94:in `scrape_one_movies_reviews'

Why is the movie ID nil for the CriticMovie Object?

Notes
Is there something inherently wrong about the database models that makes this so slow
